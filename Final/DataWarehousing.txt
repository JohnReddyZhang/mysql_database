With my database that is relative simple, I actually do not see much possibilities on
data warehousing.

However, there is two simple assumption:
1:
There is a possibility to save the count of dishes for each flavor, and store it over time,
Then you could see which flavor does most dishes have, so which flavor is most welcomed could be seen.
log in a table this data:

SELECT  count(dishName), flavorName
FROM DishTaste t
INNER JOIN Dish d
ON t.dishID = d.ID
INNER JOIN Flavor f
ON f.flavorName = t.flavorName
GROUP BY t.flavorName

The actuall abstraction could be more thorough.

And you could (by some way) add a time stamp to each set of this data,
then save it into data warehouse.
You could get preferences change on dish flavor through this.

2:
We could chronically save data from Dish, UseIngredient, and Sellsingredient table,
Then sort it by Store and Dish (into two tables, or two references)
Then you could see what is the best store to go to if you want to cook something,
And you could see if you go to a certain store, what dish is most likely to be cooked.

As a shop manager, supposedly, you could always make your own store better equipped according to this data.
And with combination of data in proposal 1, you could prepare your store for the most welcomed dishes (flavor).

Now the database is so small that this advantage won't be clear,
But as dishes build on, a manager's target on preparing products will be clearer.
